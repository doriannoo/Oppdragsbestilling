Project Y: A digital task/order request platform developed for IM Elvebakken. The solution includes a structured landing page with an order submission form built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Form data is validated and sent securely via POST requests to a Node.js/Express backend. All submitted requests are stored in a database and can be viewed and managed through an admin dashboard (order overview and deletion). The project also contains a privacy policy page and follows basic accessibility and user-friendly design principles.
